NAT reagent kit (open source),"A kit containing reagents for a nucleic acid amplification test that can be run on standard laboratory equipment such as thermocyclers. Not restrained to a specific instrument. Requires a laboratory technician, as several mixing, manual liquid transfers are required. Examples: PCR kits for conventional thermocyclers",Test format
NAT reagent kit (proprietary platform),"A kit containing reagents for a nucleic acid amplification test that can be run only on a specific instrument, for example developed by the same developer of the NAT reagent kit. Requires a laboratory technician, as several mixing, manual liquid transfers are required. Example: PCR kits designed for a single instrument (often developed by the same company)",Test format
Cartridge-based processing,"An assay in which the process is performed within a cartridge, therefore allowing some level of automation. The cartridge has in-built reagents and can perform tasks like sample preparation, extraction, amplification and detection frequently through microfluidics and microengineering. A minimally trained user inserts the sample in the cartridge and the result is obtained in usually less than 60 minutes. Example: Automated cartridge-based molecular technique",Test format
One-pot,"An assay in which the different steps of the process are performed in a single reactor/container, usually a tube. As opposed to cartridge-based processing that realizes physical isolation, the one-pot assay requires a common reaction buffer that can accommodate all steps. A minimally trained user places the sample in the tube/container and the result is read visually or obtained through the use of a device. Example: One-pot LAMP assay that combines viral RNA lysis with isothermal amplification and colorimetric read-out in a single Eppendorf tube",Test format

Mains power,Platforms with high power consumption that require Alternating Current (AC) from the mains/wall socket,Power supply
Battery-operated,"Platforms that come with a battery, either integrated (e.g. Li-ion), disposable (e.g. AA cell) or removable (plug and play)",Power supply
Portable charger compatible,Platforms that do not come up with a battery (i.e. not part of the standard kit) but have a low power consumption that allows operations for a few hours with a portable charger / power bank (that needs to be purchased separately),Power supply
Power free,"Platforms that create its own energy, for example through a chemical reaction that provides such energy or heat",Power supply
