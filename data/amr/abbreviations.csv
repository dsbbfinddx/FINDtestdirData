Abbreviation,Description
AI,Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of computer systems to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. 
AMR,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections become increasingly difficult or impossible to treat. (from the WHO Factsheet on antimicrobial resistance) "
AST,Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is a procedure usually carried out in laboratories to determine to which antimicrobials a specific microorganism or group of microorganisms are susceptible. 
CNS,Central nervous system. 
CPO,Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPO) are bacteria that have become resistant to a group of antibiotics known as carbapenems. 
ESBL,Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) are enzymes produced by certain bacteria that provide resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics.  
MIC,The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial which prevents visible growth of the microorganism. 
MRSA,Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a group of Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to several antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of infections by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. 
VRE,Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is a group of enterococci bacteria that developed resistance to an antibiotic known as vancomycin.
